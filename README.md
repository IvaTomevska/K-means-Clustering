# K-means-Clustering
Implementing K-means Clustering models from scratch.

# Introduction
K-means is one of the widely used unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the well-known clustering problem. The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set through a certain number of clusters (assume k clusters). The main idea is to define k centers, one for each cluster. These centers should be placed in a cunning way because of different location causes different result.

# Dataset
In this Project, I am generating the dataset using a third party library.
